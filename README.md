# CA Workflow

Welcome to the Quality Improvement Project! ðŸš€

In this project, we aim to enhance the quality of an existing application by implementing efficient development workflows and a robust testing strategy. The application features a front-end login form connected to an API JWT endpoint, a logout button connected to browser storage, CRUD functionality for at least one object type, and a profile page.

Using the skills and knowledge acquired in this course, our mission is to establish helpful workflows that streamline the development process and elevate the overall quality of the application.
